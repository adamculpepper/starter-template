# starter-template
=============
##### To-dos
* add apple icons
* add favicon referance to the template
* add in jquery migrate
* add in Modernizr full build with a comment to use custom build
* create a outside folder for asset creation templates like the favicon etc.
 * I say etc, but I can't actually think of another thing outside of favicons.
